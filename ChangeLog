--- 0.2.2 release ---

2009-08-14 BlackLight <blacklight@autistici.org>
	* vector.cpp: Introduced modulus() function, as a synonim for norm2();
	vectorial product has been implemented through operator '%'

	* interpolate.cpp: New file added for managing interpolation

2009-08-13 BlackLight <blacklight@autistici.org>
	* vector.cpp: Introduced polynomialInterpolation() and
	linearInterpolation() functions.

	* grassmann.hpp: Introduced for the Vector class the constructor
	Vector(std::string, char delim = ',') and the operator= (std::string).
	Now it's possible constructing a Vector from a string.
	I also redesigned the Matrix private object as std::vector<Vector>, so
	I've redefined the operator[] of Matrix class to return a reference to
	the i-th row, a reference you can set using a string.
